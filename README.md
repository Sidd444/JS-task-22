In this project, we've created a custom hook named useFetch which simplifies the process of fetching data from an API in a React application. The custom hook accepts a URL parameter and handles fetching data, loading states, and error states. We've then used this custom hook to fetch data from the JSONPlaceholder API (specifically the /posts endpoint) and displayed the fetched data in a grid format.

Features
Custom hook useFetch for fetching data from an API.
