# React Custom Hook useFetch Example

In this project, we've created a custom hook named `useFetch` which simplifies the process of fetching data from an API in a React application. The custom hook accepts a URL parameter and handles fetching data, loading states, and error states. We've then used this custom hook to fetch data from the [ JSONPlaceholder API](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and displayed the fetched data in a grid format.

## Features

- Custom hook `useFetch` for fetching data from an API.
- Displaying fetched data in a grid format.
- Error handling for failed API requests.
